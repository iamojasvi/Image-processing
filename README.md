Included Files:
---------------
1. Digantara_Assessment_Answers.pdf   - 3-page response document
2. processed_image.npy                - Output of background subtraction (simulated)
3. median_values.npy                 - Median values per 100x100 subframe
4. embedded_image_processing.c       - C code implementation of the algorithm
5. README.txt                         - This instruction file

Instructions:
-------------
- To test Python results: load the .npy files using NumPy
- To use C code: compile with any ARM or SoC-compatible compiler
- Median values and processed image are ready to be transferred to memory-mapped locations in SoC firmware

Note:
-----
Open-source libraries were used only in simulation. C implementation is clean and SoC-ready.
